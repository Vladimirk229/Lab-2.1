# Lab-2.1
1. I didn't find something really challenging as all of the topics in that course are quite understandable. However, if I choose, the most challenging from these were ARIA-properties as there are many of them and you need to know which one you should use and how should you do that. 
2. ARIA attributes are needed for screen readers to make website more accessible for people with disabilities.
3. I found a website https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ which helps to check contrast ratio between two colors. It's pretty simple and useful.
